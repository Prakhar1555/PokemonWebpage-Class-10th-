Ash Ketchum, known as Satoshi (????) in Japan, is a fictional character in the Pokémon franchise owned by Nintendo.
He is the main protagonist of the Pokémon anime and manga series, as well as on various merchandise related to the franchise.
In Japanese, the character is voiced by Rica Matsumoto; in English, he was voiced by Veronica Taylor from 1998 until 2006 and the
eighth season of the anime series, replaced by Sarah Natochenny for the remainder of the anime and Kayzie Rogers in The Mastermind
 of Mirage Pokémon television special. His name is derived from the Japanese name (as the letters 'ash' are included in 'Satoshi') 
and his English motto, "Gotta Catch 'Em All". Ash's dream is to become a Pokémon Master. He is loosely based on Red, the 
player character from the Generation I games Pokémon Red, Green, Blue and Yellow, as well as the Generation III games Pokémon
 FireRed and LeafGreen versions. The character's first official appearance in a game was in Pokémon Puzzle League.</td>
